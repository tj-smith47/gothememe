We are going to create an open-source go theme package similar to lrstanley/bubbletint, but for web instead of in the terminal. Your task specifically is to create a checklist formatted plan in this directory that future sessions will execute on - that said, be thorough and do not skimp due to context limitations. Do not declare any features as "optional" or assign relative importance - if something improves code quality or UX, it is essential. It should have the same registry of themes, complete integration & contributing documentation, an MIT license, a goreleaser config and auto-tag (there is a reusable workflow for this, don't reinvent the wheel) and release workflows, a thorough golangci-lint config tuned to enforce all go best practices and modern Go (1.25) features / idioms / techniques. It should be able to be used by all modern web frameworks, and have support for code block formatting as well. The godoc comments / context should be immaculate - this is going to be a first of its' kind, official go web theming package. It should also support custom theme generation / registration.
